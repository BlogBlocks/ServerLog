# ServerLog
Maintain a Physical NodeConsole.log instead of terminal console.log

The server is operational from the git clone ( I tried it ). I am running Ubuntu 15.04. If you have NodeJS and NPM installed,
after it is cloned run: 
$ npm start 
it will initiate localhost:3000
I have not, at this time, got the console.log working. It is a fully functional program though.
